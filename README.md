### macOS Specific

If you are downloading the macOS version of the app, use this command:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/QuickFinderApp/app/releases/download/<release>/quickfinder-macos-installer.dmg
```

If you just download it from your browser, it will be blocked by [Gatekeeper](https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/), which says 'This application is damaged' and will not let you open it.
